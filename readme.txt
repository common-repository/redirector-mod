Redirect a page to an URL or WordPress page.

== Description ==

With this Plugin you can redirect a page in your WordPress installation to any other URL, to a page in your WordPress installation or to the first child page. 

This plugin is a fork of Redirector by Ralf Hortt. It has been updated 
for WP 3.0 and does not automatically insert 'http:' before any custom
redirect thus enabling use of partial URIs and query string as your
redirect rather than fully qualified URLs.

== Installation ==

* Put the plugin file in your plugin directory and activate it in your WP backend.
* Go to edit a page
* Scroll down to 'Redirector' meta box
* Select a WordPress page of you installation or enter a valid URL or select the 'first child page'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You have to save it once to get access to the redirecor settings. Sorry for that!

== Changelog ==
